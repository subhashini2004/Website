            <h3>Sri Krishna Biography</h3>
            <p class="fst-italic">Krishna was the son of Vasudeva and Devaki but, when his maternal uncle Kamsa, the wicked king of Mathura, tried to kill him, he was smuggled across the Yamuna River to Gokula and raised by the leader of the cowherds, Nanda and his wife Yashoda.</p>
            <ul>
              <li><i class="bx bx-check-double"></i>Sri Krishna is the central figure of the Bhagavad Gita. Sri Krishna is widely considered by Hindus to be an Avatar – a direct descent of God.  During the Battle of Kurukshetra, Krishna gave Arjuna the immortal spiritual discourse of the Bhagavad Gita – Krishna taught a spiritual path of wisdom, devotion and discrimination. Sri Krishna also popularised devotional bhakti yoga through his time with Radha and the Gopis in Vrindavan.</li>
              <li><i class="bx bx-check-double"></i>“Whenever, O descendant of Bharata, righteousness declines and unrighteousness prevails, I manifest Myself. For the protection of the righteous and the destruction of the wicked, and for the establishment of religion, I come into being from age to age.”</li>
              <li><i class="bx bx-check-double"></i>Sri Krishna was born in northern India in approximately 3,228 BCE. The Puranas consider Sri Krishna’s life to mark the passing of the Dvapara age into the Kali Yuga (current age)</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Krishna was born in prison to devout parents Devaki and Vasudeva. At the time of his birth, his life was in danger because the tyrant Kamsa was seeking to kill him. It had been foretold that Kamsa would be killed by Devaki’s eighth child. Since Sri Krishna was the eighth child, he was smuggled out of prison to be raised by his foster parents Nanda and Yasoda in Gokula. Nanda lived a simple lifestyle and was a chief in the local Cow-herding community. The young Sri Krishna is often depicted in these days as being a mischievous child, who enjoyed playing pranks and having fun. Some worship Sri Krishna as the ideal child of innocence.

              However, even in his young years, Krishna is reported to have killed demons Trinavarta and Putana. He is also said to have lifted a nearby hill – Govardhana to protect the villagers against the wrath of Indra.</p>

                <p class="card-text">In the early stage of his life, Sri Krishna is also often depicted playing the flute for his beloved gopis – female devotees. Of these Radha was the greatest devotee. This life episode was crucial in the development of Hindu Bhakti devotional tradition. It is this tradition of bhakti which was important in the lives of future avatars such as Sri Chaitanya and  Sri Ramakrishna. Sri Krishna taught that there were many paths to reach the goal of self-realisation, but devotion was the shortest path“However men try to reach me, I return their love with my love; whatever path they may travel, it leads to me in the end.”</p>

                <p class="card-text">On his return to Mathura, Sri Krishna killed his uncle Kansa – after Kansa had tried several times to have Krishna killed. In Mathura, he befriended the Pandava Prince Arjuna. Sri Krishna became a counsel and friend to Arjuna.The Kurukshetra war was a battle between the Pandavas and Kauravas (led by King Dhritarashtra). Despite the provocations of the Kauravas, Sri Krishna tried to mediate to avoid a conflict. He asked the Kauravas to give the Pandavas just a small amount of land However, Dhritarashtra refused any compromise.  Once war became inevitable, Sri Krishna offered a choice to his dearest friend Arjuna – either he could choose Sri Krishna himself, or he could choose Krishna’s armies. Arjuna chose the counsel of Sri Krishna rather than his armies. </p>

Legend has it that Sri Krishna was killed by an arrow through his ankle when he was shot by a hunter, who mistook Sri Krishna for a deer. The ankle was the one area of weakness in Sri Krishna’s body. He accepted death calmly, knowing his time on earth and come to an end.</p>

              <p>Kansa had usurped the throne of Mathura from his father, the benevolent King Ugrasen. Mother Earth took the form of a cow and went to Lord Brahma, the creator God of Hinduism, with her plight. Lord Brahma then summoned Lord Vishnu, who assured Mother Earth that he would take birth as Lord Krishna to end this tyranny.</p>

              <p>Hindus believe that Jesus, like Lord Krishna, is just another avatar of the Divine, who came down to show humanity in the righteous way of life. This is another point where Krishna resembles Christ, a figure who is both "fully human and fully divine."</p>

              <p>He is worshipped as the eighth avatar of the god Vishnu and also as the supreme God in his own right.
